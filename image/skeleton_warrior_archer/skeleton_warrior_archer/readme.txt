//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello, fellow game developer! Thank you for downloading the Skeleton Warrior + Archer asset pack. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

Tips:

- Within the skeleton_warrior and skeleton_archer folders, you'll find two folders labeled "frames" and "spritesheet".
"frames" contains each animation frame as individual PNGs.

- Both the warrior and the archer have 3 color styles each. When you open the frames folder, you'll see folders corresponding with these styles.

- If you pick a style folder and open it, you'll see that each animation has its own folder.

- Alternatively, spritesheets can be found in the spritesheet folder, along with two metadata files per style. (Pick the format you like.)

- The skeleton archer's arrow is right in the skeleton archer folder. (I forgot to put it in the spritesheet, sorry!)

---FRAME DURATIONS---

Each animation has specific durations for each frame, measured in milliseconds. They are listed below.

Warrior idle: all frames 100ms
Warrior run: all frames 100ms
Warrior attack: frames 1-8 100ms, frames 9-12 50ms, frames 13-19 100ms
Warrior get_hit: all frames 75ms
Warrior block: frames 1-4 100ms, frames 5-9 50ms, frames 10-12 100ms. You can stop on frame 10 as long as you want him to block. Frames 11 and 12 are dupes of 10 but I noticed too late to remove them. :)
Warrior die: frames 1-5 75ms, frames 6-21 100ms

Archer idle: all frames 100ms
Archer run: all frames 100ms
Archer attack: frames 1-8 100ms, frame 9 400ms, frames 10-13 50ms, frames 14-20 100ms. You can adjust the duration of frame 9 to change how much time there is between the arrow pullback and release.
Archer get_hit: all frames 75ms
Archer die: frames 1-5 75ms, frames 6-21 100ms.
